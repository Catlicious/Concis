# Link

Links are less prominent than buttons, so they are often used as optional actions.

## Basic use

Base link.

<code src="./demos/index1.tsx" />

## Other status

Four statuses are provided: `primary`, `error`, `warning`, and `success`. The default is `primary`.

<code src="./demos/index2.tsx" />

## Icon link

Configure the `icon` attribute to display the icon. The default icon is displayed for `true`. You can also customize the icon.

<code src="./demos/index3.tsx" />
