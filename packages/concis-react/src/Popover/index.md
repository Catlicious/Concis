# Popover

Click/move the mouse into the element to pop up the bubble type card floating layer.

## When to use

When the target element has further descriptions and related operations, it can be included in the card and displayed according to the user's operation behavior.

The difference from Tooltip is that users can operate on elements on the floating layer, so it can carry more complex content, such as links or buttons.

## Different directions

<code src="./demos/index3.tsx" />

## Closed in floating layer
