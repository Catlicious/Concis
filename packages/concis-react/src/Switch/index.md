# Switch

Switch selector.

## When to use

- When it is necessary to indicate switch status/switching between two statuses;

- The difference between the checkbox and the switch switch is that the switch switch will directly trigger the status change, while the checkbox is generally used for status marking and needs to be coordinated with the submission operation.

## Basic use

<code src="./demos/index1.tsx"/>

## Disable Status

<code src="./demos/index2.tsx" />

## Different sizes

<code src="./demos/index3.tsx" />

## Text and Icons

<code src="./demos/index4.tsx" />

## Loading

<code src="./demos/index5.tsx" />
